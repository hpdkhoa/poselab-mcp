# Changelog

## Next

* `scan_clip` and `fix_clip`: a `pop` check takes `"gun"` for the gun bone, as every frame description calls it. An
  unknown bone name now gets an error that lists the rig's bones, not a raw `KeyError`.
* An unknown point name gets an error that lists the rig's points and the other kinds of point.
* Benchmark: `agent_bridge.py` runs the tasks with coding agents, with no API key.
* Benchmark results (benchmarks/README.md): with Claude Code agents, 3 trials per task, measured agents passed 15 of
  15 and vision agents 11 of 15. The run data is in `benchmarks/runs/2026-10-08-claude-code/`.
* Benchmark: the `turn_only` prompt names the `stock` pivot and allows any roll. An agent showed that a turn about the
  `bore` pivot does show the port, so the old prompt had no single right answer.

## 0.2.1

* Tool errors now reach the client with their message. Before, a missing Blender showed only "Error executing tool
  load_rig". Now the client reads "Blender not found: set POSELAB_BLENDER ...".
* The benchmark checks for Blender and for Anthropic credentials before it starts. The credential check is a free
  token count, so a run with no key stops at once and records nothing.

## 0.2.0

Motion: Pose Lab now checks and mends whole clips, not only poses.

* `record_clip`: a clip from poses keyed at times, eased from key to key.
* `load_clip`: a clip from a `.pose.json`, an FBX or a BVH file, with a bone name map.
* `scan_clip`: every frame against checks, with the worst value, when, and the time spans that fail. New checks:
  `contact`, `hold` (a hand's drift on the rifle) and `pop` (sudden jumps).
* `fix_clip`: mends pops, holds, contacts and clearance, and reports the scan before and after. It also lists the
  frames where a hand must be somewhere its arm cannot reach.
* `save_clip`: writes `.pose.json` and FBX into the output folder only.

Fixes:

* Bone scale no longer drifts during long solves. Rounding in the arm IK built up over hundreds of moves and
  stretched the parts on the bones (seen in 0.1.0 renders after `solve`). The drift also changed measurements: the
  0.1.0 README said a move met every goal on my game's AK rig. With the fix, no sample of 400 meets all four.
* `solve` reports how many samples met every goal together (`all_met_in_samples`).
* The sample rig's arms are now adult length (30 cm and 28 cm). The left arm was fully stretched at idle, so any move
  of the rifle pulled its hand off the handguard.

## 0.1.0

First release: 17 tools for measured poses, the solver, renders, and the built-in sample rig.
