# Claude Code tool descriptions for this run

The trial agents used two Claude Code tools: Bash (Pose Lab tool calls through agent_bridge.py) and Read (opening
render PNGs). The texts below are the Bash and Read descriptions in the Claude Code 2.1.289 session that started the
agents, copied word for word. The sub-agents run in the same Claude Code install, but their own copy is not saved in
their transcripts, so this is the closest record available.

The sub-agent's system prompt is not saved anywhere it can be read. It comes from Claude Code 2.1.289 for the
`general-purpose` agent type.

## Bash

Executes a bash command and returns its output.

This tool runs Git Bash (POSIX sh), not cmd.exe or PowerShell. Use Unix shell syntax: `/dev/null` not `NUL`, forward slashes, `$VAR` not `%VAR%` or `$env:VAR`. Do not use PowerShell here-strings (`@'…'@`) or backtick continuation here — for multi-line strings use a heredoc.

- Working directory persists between calls, but prefer absolute paths — `cd` in a compound command can trigger a permission prompt. Shell state (env vars, functions) does not persist; the shell is initialized from the user's profile.
- Command output is displayed to you, not reliably to the user.
- `timeout` is in milliseconds: default 120000, max 600000 for a foreground command.
- `run_in_background` runs the command detached: it keeps running across turns and re-invokes you when it exits. No `&` needed. Foreground `sleep` is blocked; use Monitor with an until-loop to wait on a condition.

# Git
- Interactive flags (`-i`, e.g. `git rebase -i`, `git add -i`) are not supported in this environment.
- Use the `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (PRs, issues, API).
- Commit or push only when the user asks. If on the default branch, branch first.
- End git commit messages and PR bodies with the attribution lines given in the conversation's system-reminder, when one is present.

## Read

Reads a file from the local filesystem.

- `file_path` must be an absolute path.
- Reads up to 2000 lines by default.
- When you already know which part of the file you need, only read that part. This can be important for larger files.
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- Reads images (PNG, JPG, …) and presents them visually. Reads PDFs via the `pages` parameter (e.g. "1-5", max 20 pages/request; required for PDFs over 10 pages). Reads Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) as cells with outputs.
- Reading a directory, a missing file, or an empty file returns an error or system reminder rather than content.
- Do NOT re-read a file you just edited to verify — Edit/Write would have errored if the change failed, and the harness tracks file state for you.
